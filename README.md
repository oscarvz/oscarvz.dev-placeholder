# Placeholder page for [oscarvz.dev](https://oscarvz.dev)

Currently I'm working on a nice personal website but it's not finished yet.
For now this simple placeholder has to do, but soon I'll deploy the new project.

Am I going to write instructions for this..? Sure, why not.

## Instructions

- Navigate to [oscarvz.dev](https://oscarvz.dev)
- Wow!

To run this project locally, simply just:

- Clone repo
- Navigate to the `public/` directory
- Open `index.html` in your favourite browser
- Wow!

Project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
