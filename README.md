# Placeholder page for [oscarvz.dev](https://oscarvz.dev)

Currently I'm working on a nice personal website but it's not finished yet.
For now this simple placeholder has to do, but soon I'll deploy the new project.

## Instructions
To run this project locally, simply just:

- Clone repo
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in your terminal
- Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your terminal
- Open `public/index.html`

---

Project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
A special thanks to the contributors of [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons). I'm obviously not making use of React here, but the repo makes it easy to find & use SVG icons easily.
